# GPT-Pedagogy

## Out Project

GPT-3 is a Large Language Model which can be used to cheat students out of the 
opportunity to learn. Our intended use case of GPT enables the transparent use of 
the technology between instructor and student, and will (hopefully) create a 
more active and participatory learning environment. Our long-term goal for 
higher education is along the lines of the UN SDG 4:

> “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
> learning opportunities for all”

We view GPT as a way to create an adaptive learning experience which 
promotes the educational endeavor rather than detracts from it.

## Our Goal

We are a group of students, taking the Xinformatics course with 
Dr. Thilanka Munasignhe, looking to partner with a faculty member to create a 
GPT-3 derived adaptive learning assistant for a freshman or sophomore level 
course. By creating this personalized AI tutor we can make it easier and more 
transparent for students to learn the material and reduce their stress. 

This is a class project, and we aim to have a finished product in the next two 
months which can be rolled out into your curriculum for the fall 2023 semester. 
This product will work especially well for courses where it is difficult to 
give personalized feedback to each learner in each class meeting time 
(a high student: faculty ratio). It will also work well for courses with 
students interested in AI who cannot adequately engage with that interest 
through the course material.

## Our Methods

To achieve these goals, we plan to use GPT-3 as a base model, fine-tuning it on
some selected course material to provide more accurate information and help to students.
The resulting model, tentatively *Mathesis*, will maintain its conversational abilities
while providing a more helpful teaching experience than the untrained base model.
